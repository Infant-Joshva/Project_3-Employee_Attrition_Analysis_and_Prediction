# 🧠 Employee Attrition & Performance Prediction

Employee Attrition & Performance Prediction is a Data Science project that uses machine learning models to analyze and predict key HR metrics. 
It focuses on predicting **employee attrition**, **performance ratings**, and **promotion likelihood** using structured employee data.  
The project integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, delivering insights through visualizations and metrics.
