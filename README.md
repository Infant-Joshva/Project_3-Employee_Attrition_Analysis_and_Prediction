# Employee Insights – Predictive Analytics

## 📌 Overview
**Employee Insights** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting key HR-related outcomes such as attrition, performance ratings, and promotion likelihood. The project leverages employee data to help organizations make informed decisions and improve workforce management.

By identifying high-risk employees for attrition, estimating performance ratings, and predicting promotion opportunities, the system provides actionable insights for HR teams to take preventive and growth-oriented measures.

## 🎯 Project Goals
This project focuses on **two primary predictions** (you can choose based on dataset availability):

1. **Employee Attrition Prediction**
   - **Goal:** Predict whether an employee will leave the company.
   - **Target Variable:** `Attrition` (1 = Leave, 0 = Stay)
   - **Example Features:** Age, Department, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, Years at Company, Marital Status, Overtime.

2. **Performance Rating Prediction**
   - **Goal:** Predict the employee’s performance rating.
   - **Target Variable:** `PerformanceRating`
   - **Example Features:** Education, Job Involvement, Job Level, Monthly Income, Years at Company, Years in Current Role.

(Alternative: You can also predict **promotion likelihood** based on performance, job level, and tenure.)

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases
- **Attrition Prevention:** Identify employees likely to leave and implement retention strategies.
- **Performance Assessment:** Predict ratings for better performance reviews and career growth planning.
- **Promotion Planning:** Forecast potential promotions to encourage career development.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - pandas, numpy – Data handling
  - matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
  - scikit-learn – Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Development environment

## 🔍 Approach

### 1. Data Preparation
- Clean and preprocess employee dataset.
- Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key trends and relationships between features and target variables.
- Identify patterns affecting attrition, performance, and promotions.

### 3. Model Building
- Train ML models like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, or **Random Forest**.
- Split dataset into **train/test** sets for evaluation.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Regression:** RMSE, MAE
